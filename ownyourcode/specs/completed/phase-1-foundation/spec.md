# Feature: Project Foundation (Phase 1)

> Generated by OwnYourCode. Review and modify as needed.

## User Story

As a speedcuber, I want to connect to a competition room with other cubers so that we can race against each other in real-time.

## Acceptance Criteria

When these pass, the feature is DONE:

- [x] Two clients can connect to the Socket.IO server simultaneously
- [x] Users can create a room (generates unique room ID, user becomes host)
- [x] Users can join an existing room using the room ID
- [x] Joining a non-existent room shows clear error message
- [x] When joining a room, other participants receive a notification
- [x] Project structure follows client/server separation with TypeScript
- [x] npm workspace is configured for monorepo management
- [x] Server tracks active rooms and validates room existence

## Edge Cases

| Scenario | Expected Behavior |
|----------|-------------------|
| Server not running | Client shows "Connecting..." or connection error |
| Room doesn't exist | Server returns "room-not-found" error, client shows error message |
| Create room with duplicate ID | Server prevents duplicates (or generates unique ID) |
| Same socket joins room twice | Socket remains in room, no duplicate entries |
| Client disconnects | Server detects disconnect, other clients notified |
| Invalid room ID format | Server accepts any string as room ID (flexible) |
| Port already in use | Server crashes with clear error message |
| CORS errors | Server configured to accept connections from client origin |

## Out of Scope

What this feature does NOT include (keeps focus):

- Scramble generation (Phase 2)
- Timer/stopwatch UI (Phase 2)
- User nicknames/identification (Phase 2)
- Leaderboards or race results (Phase 2)
- Database persistence (future feature)
- Authentication (future feature)

## Dependencies

Before starting:
- [ ] Node.js 18+ installed
- [ ] npm available
- [ ] Ports 3000 (server) and 5173 (client) available
