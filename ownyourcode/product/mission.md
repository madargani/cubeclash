# Project Mission

## The Problem

Speedcubers can't race against each other when they are far away. It's also hard to simulate a competition feel when practicing alone. There's no easy way for cubers to compete in real-time, share the same scrambles, and see live results together.

## Who Is This For?

**Real users (product)** — Speedcubers who want to:
- Compete with friends remotely
- Practice with a competition-like atmosphere
- Join virtual speedcubing tournaments
- Track their performance against others in real-time

## Definition of Done

When these things work, the project is COMPLETE:

- [ ] Users can create and join competition rooms
- [ ] Users engage in a virtual speed cube competition experience
- [ ] Users in the same room receive the same scrambles and race against each other
- [ ] Users get live leaderboard updates after each round
- [ ] Timing UI is similar to cstimer (familiar to speedcubers)
- [ ] Rooms support multiple participants (target: 2-10+ per room)
- [ ] Scrambles are fair and validated (WCA-compliant algorithms)
- [ ] Race results are synchronized across all clients in real-time

## Why This Matters

Speedcubing is a global community, but physical competitions only happen occasionally and in specific locations. This platform bridges the gap by creating a virtual competition environment where cubers can race against each other anytime, anywhere — maintaining the thrill of head-to-head competition even when practicing solo or connecting with cubers across the world.
